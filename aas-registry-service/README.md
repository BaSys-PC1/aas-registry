# Asset Administration Registry Server


## Overview  

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

## Testing

The integration tests start a kafka and an elasticsearch instance using [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/), so you need to start a docker daemon first.
