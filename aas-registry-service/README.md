# Asset Administration Registry Server

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

It is based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), uses [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/de/elastic-stack/) as document store and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) to notify on shell or submodel registration-updates.

## Testing

The integration tests start an Apache Kafka and an ElasticSearch instance using [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/), so you need to start up a docker daemon before running the tests.

## Docker

To run the server from a docker-compose script locally, execute the following shell-scripts from the current folder:
- *./mvn-install.sh* to create the output jar file
- *./docker-build.sh* to build the docker image (docker daemon needs to be running)
- *./docker-compose-up.sh* to start all involved services

Now that your instances are running:
- Check the installation from the started [portainer instance](http://localhost:9090)
- Open [http://localhost:8020/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8020/swagger-ui/) or [http://localhost:8020/registry/shell-descriptors/](http://localhost:8020/registry/shell-descriptors/) to test the backend
- If you want to test the application from your eclipse IDE, run "RegistryServiceDocker.launch"
- Use *./docker-compose-down.sh* to tear down the components again
