# Asset Administration Registry Server


## Overview  

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Start your server as an simple java application  


## Testing

The integration tests start a kafka and an elasticsearch instance using [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/), so you need to start a docker daemon first.

## Docker

To run the server from a docker-compose script locally, execute the following shell-scripts from the current folder:
- *./mvn-install.sh* to create the output jar file
- *./docker-build.sh* to build the docker image (docker daemon needs to be running)
- *./docker-compose-up.sh* to start to create all involved services
- You can check the installation from the [portainer installation](http://localhost:9090)
- Open [http://localhost:8020/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8020/swagger-ui/) or [http://localhost:8020/registry/shell-descriptors/](http://localhost:8020/registry/shell-descriptors/) to test the backend
- *./docker-compose-down.sh* to tear down the components
