# Asset Administration Registry Server Base Model

The project provides model classes generated out of the OpenAPI description. It is referenced in the base server project POM and as 'provided'. Thus, you can either reference the model again in your server implementation and include these model classes or implement your own model classes that better fits your need for the storage model classes.
